# energySavingSolution
The goal of this project is to reduce co2 emission by evaluating different routes that a commuter can take, 
and offering them to use "soft-transport", including walking and riding a bike.



We log in to sasdie.irisa.fr, using credintials provided by IMT Atlantique instructors, Francois Bodin.
We then can have
We retrieve commuter's home address from a database.
We calculate the geo distance between home to work address, using Navisia 
  * We create an account in Navisia
  * We use the generated token in order to get connected to the server
  * We calculate each person's data, including the distance to their office, the co2_emission
  * The distance between the commuter's home address to the office
  * We find the different paths for them based on their distance
